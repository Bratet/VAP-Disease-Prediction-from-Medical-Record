    "Implementing a hierarchical model for handling multiple reports per patient involves a two-level architecture. The first level processes individual reports, and the second level aggregates the outputs across these reports to make a final prediction for each patient. Here's a step-by-step guide to implement this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Preprocessing:\n",
    "- **Segment Reports**: Ensure each patient's reports are segmented correctly and gathered together.\n",
    "- **Tokenization**: Tokenize each report using the tokenizer appropriate for your transformer model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. First-Level Transformer Model:\n",
    "- **Model Selection**: Choose a suitable transformer model (like BERT, GPT, etc.) for text analysis.\n",
    "- **Process Each Report**: Feed each report into the transformer model individually. This model will capture the nuances and details in each report.\n",
    "- **Output Representation**: Extract a fixed-size vector representation for each report. This could be the [CLS] token's embedding in BERT, for example, or a pooled representation of all token embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Second-Level Aggregation Model:\n",
    "- **Input**: The input to this model is the sequence of vector representations from the first-level model, one for each report.\n",
    "- **Model Choice**: You can use another transformer, an RNN (like LSTM or GRU), or even simpler methods like averaging or max pooling. The choice depends on the importance of understanding the sequence and relationships between reports.\n",
    "- **Temporal Information**: If the order of reports is important, an RNN or transformer as the second-level model is preferable as it can capture temporal dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Training:\n",
    "- **Batching**: When batching data, ensure that each batch contains a sequence of report embeddings for each patient. Handle variable lengths either by padding or by using dynamic batching.\n",
    "- **Loss Function and Optimization**: Choose a loss function that aligns with your prediction task (binary classification, multi-class classification, etc.). Optimize the model using gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Prediction:\n",
    "- **Aggregated Output**: The second-level model will provide an aggregated output representing the collective information from all reports of a patient.\n",
    "- **Final Prediction**: Use this output to make the final prediction (e.g., patient's health status).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Practical Considerations:\n",
    "- **Memory Constraints**: Depending on your model size and the number of reports, you may face memory constraints. It's important to manage the computational resources effectively.\n",
    "- **Sequence Lengths**: Be mindful of the maximum sequence length of the transformer model, especially at the first level.\n",
    "- **Model Complexity**: This approach is more complex and might require careful tuning and sufficient training data to capture the relationships effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Example Architecture:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class HierarchicalTransformerModel(nn.Module):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, transformer_model, second_level_model):\n",
    "        super().__init__()\n",
    "        self.transformer_model = transformer_model  # First level\n",
    "        self.second_level_model = second_level_model  # Second level\n",
    "\n",
    "    def forward(self, batch_of_reports):\n",
    "        # Process each report with transformer_model\n",
    "        # Aggregate report embeddings\n",
    "        # Feed aggregated embeddings to second_level_model\n",
    "        # Return final prediction\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Implementation:\n",
    "- **Frameworks**: Implement this in a deep learning framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow.\n",
    "- **Data Handling**: Carefully handle the data to ensure reports are correctly aligned with patients.\n"
